Discord bot for you to keep track of how many times you do it in a day. 

Only supporting linux for now.

Follow this tutorial on creating a bot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMmUW4d3Noc
I didn't provide a .env file, you have to create it yourself.

run "node index.js" in the main directory to start the bot.

Create a new discord channel for your log and only allow you and the bot to send message.
